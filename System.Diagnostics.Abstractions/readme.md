System.Diagnostics.Abstractions.Enhanced is a NuGet package that provides abstractions for the System.Diagnostics namespace in .NET. It allows you to write testable and mockable code that relies on the System.Diagnostics functionality.

## Installation

You can install the package via NuGet package manager or by using the .NET CLI.

### NuGet Package Manager

1. Search for "System.Diagnostics.Abstractions" in the NuGet package manager UI.
2. Click on the "Install" button to add the package to your project.

### .NET CLI

Run the following command in the root directory of your project:
## Usage

To use the abstractions provided by this package, simply include the `System.Diagnostics.Abstractions` namespace in your code files:
Now you can use the abstractions from the `System.Diagnostics` namespace in your code, such as `Process`, `EventLog`, and `PerformanceCounter`. This allows you to write testable code that can be easily mocked for unit testing.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the abstractions provided by this package:

### Example 1: Starting a process
### Example 2: Writing to an event log
### Example 3: Retrieving performance counter values
